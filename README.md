# smartsubmit
A package for managing the baby-making backdoor on the TAS cluster.

## About

Smartsubmit has two basic functions. 

The first is to act as a sort of filesystem for CMS3 ntuples across drives on the TAS cluster. Each ntuple is associated with a 'sample,' e.g. ttbar_powheg_pythia8_25ns for ttbar events generated by the pythia8/powheg driven montecarlo with 25ns spacing, and conversly each sample consists of a collection of these ntuples files. Smartsubmit copies sample files from the hadoop filesystem onto to a subset of machines in the TAS cluster. By effectively managing the location of these ntuple files, smartsubmit maximizes parallelizability in converting CMS3 ntuples into TAS babies. 

To utilize a sample with smartsubmit, the ntuple files must be absorbed into the smartsubmit database. This is achieved using smartsubmit_ctrl.
